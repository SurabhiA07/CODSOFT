## Description
- Tik-Tak-Toe AI : Implementing an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. Algorithms like Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning Are used.  Minimax is a decision-making algorithm used for minimizing the possible loss for a worst-case scenario.In the context of games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Minimax aims to find the best move by recursively evaluating all possible future game states.Alpha-beta pruning is an optimization technique used to reduce the number of nodes evaluated by the Minimax algorithm.It works by maintaining two values, alpha and beta, which represent the minimum score the maximizing player is assured of and the maximum score the minimizing player is assured of, respectively.
- Face Detection And Recognition System : Developed an AI application that can detect and recognize faces in images using pre-trained face detection models like Haar cascades.Haar cascades are machine learning-based algorithms used to detect objects (in this case, faces) in images or video frames.The main functionality of the code lies in the process_image() function, which orchestrates the face detection and recognition process.
- Recommendation System : Created a simple recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences. Algorithms and techniques like tf-idf vectorization, cosine similarity, recommendation generation are used.TF-IDF is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus).Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure the similarity between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space. It calculates the cosine of the angle between the vectors.The get_recommendations() function takes an input item (movie) and calculates its similarity with other items using cosine similarity.
- Chat Bot with Rule Based Responses : Building a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on pre-defined rules. Using if-else statements and Regular Expression techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses.The match_reply() method matches the user's input against predefined intents using regular expressions and selects the appropriate response based on the matched intent.The bot prompts the user for input and processes the responses iteratively until the user decides to exit.
